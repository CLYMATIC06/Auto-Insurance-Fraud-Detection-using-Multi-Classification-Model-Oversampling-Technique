This project aims to build a robust auto insurance model leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. 
The primary focus is on multi-classification to predict various insurance claim outcomes. 
The dataset used for training is imbalanced, where certain classes may have fewer instances. 
To address this, oversampling techniques are employed to enhance model generalization
